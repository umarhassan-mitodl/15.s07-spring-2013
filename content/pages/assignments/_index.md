To support the projects, class sessions are designed to be interactive and connect to key issues for all projects. Every Wednesday, teams submit a WedUp—a simple, consistently formatted status update that enables project progress while documenting work steps to support learning. On Fridays, team assignments are due. Most are brief and all are designed to support project work. In April, students complete an assignment that distills their learning in the field to share lessons learned with others.

Below is a list of the major assignments, categorized by type, and their respective due dates. For a detailed breakdown of tasks and action items ordered chronologically, see the {{% resource_link "564190aa-addb-75cb-a44f-633498ae2eb9" "Deliverables and Action Steps" %}} page.

The {{% resource_link "47215376-16bf-1561-ccc4-32c598a740a1" "Sloan portfolio (PDF)" %}} is designed in part to meet the {{% resource_link "155edcc2-1663-45ca-990c-333f7920a9eb" "MIT Sloan Innovation Period (SIP)" %}} requirements and will be completed in pairs. You must select your plan by the end of Week 2, and complete the assignment by the end of Week 11.

Within each team, select one visual option and one written option.

### Visual

- Video that presents the project, the solution, the host, and the setting

### Written

- Blog journal of 5–7 posts that tell a story over the course of your project
- Standalone management module that takes something you did and presents it to a general audience (e.g., a how to guide; or a checklist with detailed explanations)
- Initial draft of a case
