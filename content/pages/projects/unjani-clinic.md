During their visit, the team observed six clinics and conducted over 80 interviews with competitors, Unjani nurses and staff, customers, and consumers. The team outlined standardized marketing models, partnerships, and nurse-designed training materials with the hopes that they will ensure quality of customer experience and a consistent value proposition.
