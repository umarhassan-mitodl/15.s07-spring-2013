### Location

Johannesburg, South Africa

### Project Summary

Expansion plan for a clinic-in-a-box franchise initiative

### The Opportunity

Unjani Clinic, a CSI project of Imperial Health Sciences, is a nurse-run, for-profit healthcare clinic-in-a-box franchise initiative. Unjani is addressing the healthcare delivery gap between the private (at R300 a visit) and public clinics (free of charge) in South Africa. The franchise model provides both the opportunity for the nurses to become entrepreneurs and the opportunity for the community to access quality, affordable healthcare. Currently, Unjani has seven clinics and aims to scale up to 2,500 clinics across the country. In order to scale up successfully, Unjani has to tackle two challenges: how to increase patient volume; and what is the appropriate pricing strategy going forward.

Identification of bottlenecks along patient pathway to improve patient wait time

### The Opportunity

LVPEI is an eye care hospital that has served over 15 million people, with 50% of its patients at no cost. Its mission is to provide equitable and efficient eye care to all sections of society. The hospital naturally faces large patient volumes and is concerned that its capacity constraint is creating long wait time for its patients. Opportunity exists in capturing dynamic changes in patient demand and patient pathway.
